                    <h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
                    <p>When you start programming your first web app you are doing something that you have never done before. It's a new challenge, a new opportunity, and in the case of software development, something so specific that it's probably never been done before.</p>
 
                    <p>In the beginning, it is normal to feel confused. Don't worry! There are so many resources available to get you going when you feel stuck or confused.</p>

                <h4>Be patient, stay focused</h4>
                <p>Think about long it takes to become fluent in a new language. Learning to code will take some time and a lot of practice, but most importantly patience.</p>
 
                <p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part of the process.</p>
